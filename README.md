# Random Song Tournament Assitant

This project is a continuation of the BeatSaverMapAnalyzer project (https://github.com/ZelonGames/BeatsaverMapAnalyzer)

This program is used to make it easier to host a random song beat saber tournament. It's also useful for people that just wants to download some random maps with a few filters.
